      <p>You can never be too sure. Sometimes you miss things that are sitting right in front of you. It could be like that.</p>

      <p>Obviously not. Stop playing games. You emptied the laundry yesterday. You must have dropped it somewhere and forgot, again.</p>

      <p>It's not here. Maybe we should try thinking outside the box?</p>

      <p>People leave things here all the time. You're lucky they haven't cleaned up after your stay yet. Technically you've already checked out, so you should probably leave before the maid comes.</p>

      <p>Ooh, this was fun the last time you were here. And you've been looking so hard! Another wouldn't hurt. It's only 25&cent. Just get one, and you can chew it while you think.</p>

      <h2>Well, shoot. It's alright, we can just wear one sock. Who cares?</h2>
      <p>Oh, wait, look up.</p>

      <p>It's already nighttime. You spent the whole day trying to find one sock. I mean, at least you won't have to walk around half bare-footed now. You won't have to explain it to anybody, right?</p>
      <p>That's kind of funny!</p>
